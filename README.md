# Running

In order to reproduce this work you only need to change the paths to your local machine and run in this order:

01.preprocessing.R

02.pca_components_choice.R

03.k_means_clustering.R

04.tsne_exploration

All analysis and plots are produced with these scripts, and the final report, avaliable in https://rpubs.com/araujoamf/philosophy-tsne-clustering is the report.Rmd.
